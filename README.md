# Electrotechnics Club Repository

Welcome to the official repository for the AZ-Centrum Electrotechnics Club, hosted by **B:TECH a.s.**. This repository serves as a resource hub for participants interested in expanding their knowledge in the fields of **computer vision**, **automation**, and **embedded systems**.

## About the Repository

The current focus of our club revolves around the integration of **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**—two powerful libraries for real-time computer vision and machine learning. Here, you will find tutorials, code samples, and exercises designed to deepen your understanding of these technologies.

This repository is continually updated with new materials that will assist in exploring various applications, from object detection and tracking to human pose estimation and gesture recognition.

## Technologies and Tools

- **OpenCV**: A comprehensive library used for real-time image processing and computer vision tasks. We utilize it for foundational image manipulation, edge detection, object detection, and more.
- **MediaPipe**: A cross-platform framework for building multimodal (e.g., video, audio) machine learning pipelines. Currently, we're working on integrating human pose estimation and hand gesture recognition using this tool.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

 
    git clone https://github.com/NexDevTech/N3x-Electrotechnics-Club.git
   

2. **Navigate to the project folder** and follow the instructions provided in each subfolder for specific exercises.

3. **Install required dependencies** using the following:


    pip install -r requirements.txt


4. **Run the examples** and modify the scripts to experiment with various parameters and functions.

## Target Audience

This repository is intended for participants of the AZ-Centrum Electrotechnics Club, primarily those with a background or interest in:

- **Industrial Automation**
- **Embedded Systems**
- **Machine Learning & AI**

While the content here is tailored for the club's members, it is also a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning how to leverage computer vision technologies in practical applications.
